# Call for Papers

The SSDBM international conference brings together scientific domain experts, database researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of current research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scientific and statistical database applications. The 37th SSDBM will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation and evaluation. The conference program typically consists of a single track to facilitate discussion, and contains presentations of invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems.

SSDBM 2025 will be hosted by the The Ohio State University and will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship and exchange of ideas in all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management, and high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for distributed datasets.

The Proceedings of SSDBM 2025 will be published by [Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://www.acm.org/) [International Conference Proceeding Series (ICPS)](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps) and will appear in the [ACM Digital Library](https://www.acm.org/publications/digital-library) and many [indexing providers](https://authors.acm.org/journals/journals-indexing-list). 
<!-- The best papers will be considered for publication in the [Distributed and Parallel Databases (DAPD)](https://www.springer.com/journal/10619) – An International Journal of Data Science, Engineering, and Management, Springer, ISSN: 0926-8782.
-->
## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts. All submissions should be formatted using the ACM format available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) by selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. For submissions prepared in LaTex,  authors are recommended to use \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} conﬁguration. 
SSDBM 2025 is single-blind reviewed; authors must include their names and affiliations on the first page. 
All authors should respect [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) and use of large language models (LLMs). 
At least one author of each accepted paper or poster _must register and plan to attend_ the conference in-person. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission.

* Submission deadline: (Final Extension) May 8 at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)
* Submission site: [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssdbm2025) 

## Research Papers 

Research papers are up to 12 pages (including references and appendices). Papers should be descriptions of complete technical work. The program committee may decide to accept some long papers as short papers or posters. Long papers will be given a presentation slot in the conference, while short papers will be given a short presentation slot in the conference and presented in the form of posters. All papers, regardless of size, will be given an entry in the conference proceedings.

## Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model

ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here: https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance.

Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows:

- [Full details of the new ICPS publishing model.](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/faq)
- [Full details of the ACM Open program.](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess)

Please direct all questions about the new model to icps-info@acm.org.
