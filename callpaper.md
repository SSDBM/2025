# Call for Papers

The **International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management 2025** aims to bring together domain experts, data management researchers, practitioners, and developers to present and exchange the latest research findings on concepts, tools, and techniques for scalable scientific data management. While previous editions of SSDBM primarily focused on scientific statistical databases, the 37th edition in 2025 will broaden its scope to encompass all areas of scalable and scientific data management. Reflecting this expanded focus, the conference has been renamed from the International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management to the ***International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management***, while retaining the well-known acronym, SSDBM.

The new SSDBM conference will serve as a forum for original research contributions, as well as practical system design, implementation, and evaluation of the latest advances in scalable and scientific data management. The program typically features a single-track format to foster active discussion and includes invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems.

SSDBM 2025 will be hosted by The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, from June 23 to June 25, 2025. Continuing the tradition of past SSDBM meetings, SSDBM 2025 will offer a stimulating environment designed to foster discussion, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas on all aspects of scientific and statistical data management research, as well as high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for distributed datasets. 

The Proceedings of SSDBM 2025 will be published by Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference Proceeding Series (ICPS) and will appear in the ACM Digital Library and many indexing providers. [Acceptance pending]

## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts. 
- Regular Research Papers are up to 12 pages (including references and appendices). Papers should be descriptions of complete technical work. 
- All submissions should be formatted using the ACM format available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) by selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. For submissions prepared in LaTex, authors are recommended to use \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} conﬁguration. 
- SSDBM 2025 is single-blind reviewed; authors must include their names and affiliations on the first page. All authors should respect ACM Policy on Authorship and use of generative AI tools and technologies (details on the policy are available at [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

Submission site: [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssdbm2025)

The program committee may decide to accept some papers as short papers or posters. Regular papers will be given a presentation slot in the conference, while short papers will be given a short presentation slot in the conference. Regular papers (up to 12 pages including references) and Short papers (up to 6 pages including references) will be included as part of the conference proceedings. Posters with a single page abstract and electronic poster presentation will be published on the conference website, without proceedings. 

If your paper is selected, at least one author must register for the Technical Program in order to attend the conference and present the paper. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission. For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, the author has to present the paper at the conference in person. Otherwise, the paper will be removed from the proceedings.
