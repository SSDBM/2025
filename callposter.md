# Call for Posters

The SSDBM international conference brings together scientific domain experts, database researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of current research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scientific and statistical database applications. The 37th SSDBM will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation and evaluation. The conference program typically consists of a single track to facilitate discussion, and contains presentations of invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems.

SSDBM 2025 will be hosted by The Ohio State University and will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship and exchange of ideas in all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management, and high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for distributed datasets.

## Research Posters 

There will be a poster session where participants will have the opportunity to present their ongoing research with new problems/solutions; and receive feedback from the community. Accepted posters will also be given a short presentation slot in the conference. 

Posters will be subject to a very light scope and presentation check. The number of accepted posters is limited by the  poster space available.

Poster submissions consist of: 
* An extended abstract (extended abstracts should not exceed 2 pages and should be formatted using the ACM format available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template by selecting the generic “sigconf” sample.).
Authors must include their names and affiliations on the first page.
*  A draft of the proposed poster (organized as one A0-size sheet, in vertical (preferred) or horizontal layout).

Extended abstracts will be published on the SSDBM 2025 website at the time of the conference. 
Research Posters (extended abstracts) will not be included in the proceedings. 

At least one author of each accepted poster must register and plan to attend  the conference in-person (student rate applies for student posters). Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission. 

* Submission deadline: (Final Extension) June 30 at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)
* Submission site: [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssdbm2025)
