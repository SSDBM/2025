## Keynote 1: [Manish Parashar](https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/parashar.html)

**TITLE:** Catalyzing the Transformative Impact of Open Science Data

**ABSTRACT:** Open data is integral to the scientific process and a key enabler of innovations and discoveries across all disciplines, and essential to addressing important scientific and societal grand challenges, especially given the increasing use of AI/ML. As a result, open and equitable access to this data is more critical than ever. This talk will discuss the importance and urgency of open data access and explore some of the barriers and challenges to such access. It then introduces the vision and architecture of the National Data Platform project, as part of a broader national cyberinfrastructure, aimed at catalyzing an open and extensible data ecosystem, and highlights key use cases.

## Keynote 2: [Rob Ross](https://www.anl.gov/profile/robert-b-ross)

**TITLE:** Supporting Science Through Data Management Software

**ABSTRACT:** Successful science relies on data in many forms. Data management in computational science historically revolved around inputs and outputs of simulations and middleware libraries executed on HPC platforms. More recently, increasingly complex workflows, coupled with a greater variety of computational tasks, has prompted the development of new data management software to meet new requirements, including streaming services, specialized model repositories, and vector databases. Rapid change driven by AI and the incorporation of geographically distributed resources is altering the landscape yet again.
This talk will first discuss recent progress, successes, and lessons learned through our efforts to better understand and accelerate the development of data management services for computational science. It then pivots to consider trends in how we pursue science and their implications for data management software going forward.

## Keynote 4: [Xian-He Sun](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~scs/sun/)

**TITLE:** The Data-Centric Imperative: from Hermes to StoreHub

**ABSTRACT:** With the exponential growth of big data, AI, and data-intensive scientific applications, computing has become data-centric. Traditional I/O architectures and storage paradigms are no longer meeting the data-centric demand. A paradigm shift is needed to seamlessly integrate high-performance computing power with the velocity, volume, and variety of data to serve diverse AI demands. This keynote will explore the critical challenges and exciting opportunities in architecting next-generation storage systems and provide our current solutions for meeting these demands. We will introduce a new paradigm, named dataflow under the von Neumann machine. First, we present the C-AMAT model, which quantifies the benefits of concurrent data access and reveals the relationship between data locality and concurrency. Next, we introduce the LPM (Layer Performance Matching) framework to optimize memory system performance and formally introduce the concept of dataflow under the von Neumann machine. We then discuss our recent work in I/O systems, focusing on the Hermes multi-tiered I/O buffering system. Hermes optimizes data movement based on the LPM framework and has been a significant success. Finally, we will address some fundamental issues and present forward-thinking computer system designs for AI and big data applications, aimed at mitigating the memory-wall problem. We will discuss the critical role of collaborative research infrastructures, like the envisioned StoreHub, in accelerating progress. Such platforms are essential for enabling the co-design, testing, and validation of novel hardware and software solutions, fostering a community approach to tackling the I/O imperative, and ultimately, unlocking the full potential of data-centric scientific discovery.
