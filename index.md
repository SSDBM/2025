# Welcome to SSDBM 2025

The International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management 2025 is aimed to bring together domain experts, data management researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of the latest research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scalable and scientific data management. Previous editions of SSDBM focused on scientific statistical databases. In 2025, the scope of the 37th edition of SSDBM will be expanded to all scalable and scientific data management fields. The name of the conference is changed to International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management from the International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management, while keeping the acronym SSDBM. 

The new SSDBM conference will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation and evaluation of latest advances in scalable and scientific data management. The conference program typically consists of a single track to facilitate discussion, and contains presentations of invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems.

SSDBM 2025 will be hosted by The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The conference will be held on June 23 - 25, 2025, in the Ideation Zone of the Translational Data Analytics Institute. SSDBM 2025 will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship and exchange of ideas in all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management, and high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for distributed datasets.
